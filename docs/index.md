# Graph Synthesis Documentation

Welcome to the Graph Synthesis documentation! This comprehensive guide will help you understand and utilize our supply chain network generation and analysis platform.

## Overview

Graph Synthesis is a powerful tool designed to generate, visualize, and analyze synthetic supply chain networks. It creates realistic, temporally-aware supply chain data that can be used for:
- Supply chain modeling and simulation
- Network optimization
- Risk analysis
- Performance benchmarking
- What-if scenario analysis

## Key Features

### 1. Dynamic Network Generation
- Create complex supply chain networks with multiple hierarchical levels
- Generate realistic temporal variations in network properties
- Support for various node types and relationships
- Configurable network parameters and constraints

### 2. Interactive Visualization
- Real-time network visualization
- Interactive graph exploration
- Temporal trend analysis
- Performance metric dashboards

### 3. Advanced Analytics
- Network topology analysis
- Performance metrics calculation
- Risk assessment
- Bottleneck identification

### 4. Supply Chain Management
- Network modification capabilities
- Version control and tracking
- Configuration management
- Scenario planning
