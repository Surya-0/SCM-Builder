# Temporal Analysis in Supply Chains

## Introduction

Temporal analysis is crucial in understanding how supply chain networks evolve and perform over time. This document explains the theoretical foundations and practical applications of temporal analysis in our system.

## Time-Based Network Analysis

### 1. Temporal Networks

#### Network Evolution
- Node Addition/Removal
- Edge Creation/Deletion
- Property Changes
- State Transitions

#### Time Scales
- Short-term (Daily/Weekly)
- Medium-term (Monthly/Quarterly)
- Long-term (Yearly)

### 2. Temporal Metrics

#### Performance Over Time
- Throughput
- Utilization
- Efficiency
- Cost

#### Trend Analysis
- Pattern Recognition
- Seasonality Detection
- Anomaly Identification

## Dynamic Behavior

### 1. Supply Chain Dynamics

#### Temporal Variations
- Demand Fluctuations
