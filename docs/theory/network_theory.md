# Network Theory in Supply Chains

## Introduction

Network theory provides the mathematical and conceptual foundation for modeling and analyzing supply chain networks. This document explains the key concepts of network theory as applied to supply chain management.

## Graph Theory Fundamentals

### Directed Graphs
In our supply chain model, we use directed graphs (DiGraphs) where:
- Nodes represent entities (suppliers, warehouses, facilities)
- Edges represent relationships and flows between entities
- Direction indicates the flow of materials/products

### Network Properties

#### 1. Centrality Measures
- **Degree Centrality**: Number of direct connections
  - In-degree: Number of incoming supplies
  - Out-degree: Number of outgoing deliveries
- **Betweenness Centrality**: Importance as a bridge between other nodes
- **Closeness Centrality**: Average distance to all other nodes

#### 2. Network Metrics
- **Path Length**: Steps between nodes
- **Clustering Coefficient**: Node grouping tendency
- **Network Density**: Ratio of actual to possible connections

## Supply Chain Network Characteristics

### 1. Hierarchical Structure
- Multiple layers representing different organizational levels
- Parent-child relationships between nodes
- Vertical and horizontal relationships

### 2. Flow Dynamics
- Material flow
- Information flow
- Financial flow
- Temporal variations

### 3. Network Resilience
- Redundancy in connections
- Alternative paths
- Backup suppliers/facilities

## Graph Algorithms in Supply Chain

### 1. Path Finding
- Shortest path algorithms
- Critical path analysis
- Alternative route identification

### 2. Network Flow
- Maximum flow calculation
- Bottleneck identification
- Capacity optimization

### 3. Community Detection
- Supplier clusters
- Regional groupings
- Product family groups

## Applications in Our System

### 1. Network Generation
- Graph-based data structures
- Relationship modeling
- Constraint satisfaction

### 2. Analysis
- Performance metrics calculation
- Risk assessment
- Optimization opportunities

### 3. Visualization
- Force-directed layouts
- Hierarchical layouts
- Interactive exploration

## Best Practices

### 1. Network Design
- Balance between efficiency and resilience
- Appropriate level of redundancy
- Scalable structure

### 2. Analysis
- Regular network assessment
- Multiple metric consideration
- Context-aware interpretation

### 3. Optimization
- Multi-objective optimization
- Constraint consideration
- Trade-off analysis
